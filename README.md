# NotexBook

To speed up self-studying and organizing texts in that would otherwise rest in a paper notebook.

This actually a LaTeX package optimized for my notetaking style.

## Prerequisites

As we do not support paper to LaTeX conversion notepads, one must write their notes with LaTeX.

## Installation

### TexLive (Ubuntu)

If you do not have another LaTeX package installed as **notexbook**, then
it can be installed by running such in a shell.

1. ```git clone https://github.com/cschlay/notexbook.git```
2. ```cd notexbook```
3. ```source install.sh```
